### Quiz App Documentation
## Overview
This is a simple quiz application that fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API, presents them to the user, and evaluates their answers. The user interface is implemented using HTML & CSS, and the interactivity is handled through JavaScript. The application is designed to display one question at a time, with multiple-choice answers. After the user selects an answer, feedback is provided, and the next question is presented. The quiz concludes with a summary of the user's score.
